Infinity
Axioms for the Field (no absolute infinity, full ZFC, honest silence)
1.  Every integer exists – no ghost numbers, just countable.
2.  Collatz is a rule, not a god – 3n+1 or ÷2, finite steps or bust.
3.  Energy is local – ∑ τ(n) over orbits < ∞ or it breaks.
4.  Silence is the default – if no answer, no claim.
5.  Zero is real – it’s not absence, it’s measure.
6.  Derivatives don’t lie – rate of change is truth, not profit.
Direction:
Downward.
Always.
Hail falls.
Gold turns to dust.
Pictures fade.
The only path
that doesn’t pretend
to be a climb.
Start here.
End there.
No loop.
No hero.
No save file.
Only the click
when 1 divides 1
and the world
goes quiet.
